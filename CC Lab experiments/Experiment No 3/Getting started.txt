1) Read the problem statement.

2) Read the setup's manual (PendulumSetup_manual.pdf).

3) The matrix parameter values are given in the manual, use them to calculate the elements of the state space matrices (A, B, C and D).

4) Using these matrices, run the LQR program in MATLAB and get the gain values (K1, K2, K3 and K4) by tuning the Q matrix.

5) Use them, along with the state variables to realize the control input to the motor.

6) The datasheets for the encoder and decoder are also provided; you can use them to identify the pin connections (refer Circuit_Diagram.jpg image), which will be required for coding purposes.

7) Sample Arduino code for reading the encoder values will be provided.
