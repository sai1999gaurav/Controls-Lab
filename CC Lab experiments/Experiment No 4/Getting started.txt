1)  Read the problem statement.

2)  Connect the headphone setup to the function generator and the DSO.

3)  Give a sinusoidal waveform as the input, with frequency varying from 100 Hz - 5000 Hz.

4)  Plot the magnitude and phase response.

5)  Design an amplifier for the system to ensure 20 dB attenuation at 100 Hz for the closed loop system.

6)  Design the compensator for the system for stabilizing it without sacrificing the gain at 100 Hz.

7)  For designing the compensator, plot the bode plot for the transfer function in Matlab, superimpose it 
    with the system's bode plot to get the cascaded bode plot.

8)  Make sure that the cascaded plot has a gain margin and phase margin of atleast 5 dB and 30 degrees 
    respectively. 

9)  Tweak the parameters of the transfer function in Matlab till the required specifications are met.

10) Then close the loop and inject the noise as per the closed loop block diagram, measure the output to noise 
    ratios at 100, 500 and 1000 Hz.
